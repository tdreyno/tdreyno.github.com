          <h2>How Do I: Structure Applications</h2>
          <time>Oct  9 2012</time>
          <p>This is part two in a series of &quot;How Do I&quot; articles (<a href="/2012/10/01/how-do-i-animate.html">part one, Animation, is here</a>). These are how I, Thomas Reynolds, accompish certain tasks. This isn&#39;t about comparing multiple technique or even justifying my prefered approach. This is a brain dump.</p>

<h3>Structure Philosophy</h3>

<p>These days, I think the difference between a &quot;Site&quot; and an &quot;Application&quot; is very small. Sites may start small, be less interactive and have less state than Applications, so they don&#39;t necessarily need tools and libraries to handle those advanced issues. But it certainly doesn&#39;t hurt.</p>

<p>Site or Application, I try to start with the same tools and structure.</p>

<h3>Build System &amp; Dependency Management</h3>

<p>These two systems are often bundled together. I use <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a>, which is perfect for my needs because I wrote it. For the Ruby-adverse, or Javascript-masochists, <a href="http://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a> is gaining traction.</p>

<p>Modern applications include many libraries and, of course, developers should be modularizing their code into many, independent files as well. You <em>could</em> simply include a bunch of <code>script</code> tags in your HTML and make sure they stay in the right order, but that&#39;s immature and doesn&#39;t scale. Instead, the modules need to define what their dependencies are and let some other system make sure they load in the correct order.</p>

<p>Middleman includes <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">Sprockets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/livingsocial/rake-pipeline">Rake-Pipeline</a>. I flip flop on which one I use and I&#39;m not really happy with either of them. That said, they do their job and get out of the way.</p>

<p>The Build step is very important. It takes your code, libraries and file layout&mdash;which are optimized for your development process and speed&mdash;and converts them into fewer, smaller files optimized for bandwidth and load time.</p>

<p>Middleman makes this step simple. In my config, I add:</p>

<pre><code>configure :build do
    activate :minify_css
    activate :minify_js
end
</code></pre>

<p>And we&#39;re done. In more complicated projects, this step can also compress images, generate pre-gzipped assets and automatically run tests.</p>

<p>Regarding Javascript compilation and minification, Middleman defaults to <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a>, which is pretty much the standard for open source Javascript libraries (such as jQuery, HTML5Boilerplate, etc). I still prefer <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/">Google&#39;s Closure Compiler</a>, which has long been the best for file size, at the cost of developer happiness and the annoyances of working with a large Java tool. However, these days, Javascript file size is dwarfed my image assets so that&#39;s less important and UglifyJS is rapidly approaching Closure&#39;s efficiency.</p>

<h3>Core Libraries</h3>

<ul>
<li>DOM Wrapper (<a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/library/">Closure</a> or jQuery)</li>
<li>Browser Feature Detection (<a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a>)</li>
<li>Animation Framework (<a href="https://github.com/sole/tween.js/">tween.js</a>) </li>
<li>CSS Transform 2d/3d Support (<a href="https://github.com/sproutcore/TransformJS">TransformJS</a>)</li>
<li>Statechart (<a href="https://github.com/etgryphon/stativus">Stativus</a> or <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember.js</a>)</li>
<li>View Layer (Ember.js or something custom)</li>
<li>URL Router (Ember.js or <a href="https://github.com/joshbuddy/sherpa">Sherpa</a>)</li>
<li>Templating Library (<a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/">Soy</a> or <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a>)</li>
<li>Asset Loader (<a href="http://thinkpixellab.com/pxloader/">PxLoader</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h4>DOM Wrapper</h4>

<p>Paves over cross-browser issues with the most basic interactions with the browser. A no-brainer. I use Closure or jQuery, depending on what the client wants, but I prefer jQuery. That said, I don&#39;t use jQuery for animation or code structure (<code>$.fn.plugins</code>).</p>

<h4>Browser Feature Detection</h4>

<p><a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> detects available features and makes it easy to fallback to lesser technologies through either a Javascript or CSS interface. It also provides an HTML5 shim for older browsers. Here&#39;s a quick example:</p>

<pre><code>// JS
if (Modernizr.touch) { $(elem).on(&#39;touchstart&#39;, handler); }
</code></pre>

<p>Or</p>

<pre><code>/* CSS */
.svg { background-image: url(bg.svg); }
.no-svg { background-image: url(bg.png); }
</code></pre>

<p>Another no-brainer, this should be on every site on the web.</p>

<h4>Animation Framework</h4>

<p>As <a href="/2012/10/01/how-do-i-animate.html">I said before</a>, I use a Tween library to get the animation effects I want. jQuery doesn&#39;t use <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, so I have to use something third-party. <a href="https://github.com/sole/tween.js/">tween.js</a> is great. See the previous article for examples.</p>

<h4>CSS Transform 2d/3d Support</h4>

<p>If you want to animate rotation and scale, you&#39;re going to need CSS Transforms. Using these transforms also has the side-effect of moving their rendering to the GPU, so replacing animations of position <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> can be faster if transforming <code>translateY</code> and <code>translateX</code> are used instead. <a href="https://github.com/sproutcore/TransformJS">TransformJS</a> is a polyfill that uses the best available technique. 3d transforms for those which support it, falling back to 2d transforms and finally top/left positioning. The API looks like:</p>

<pre><code>$(elem).css({ transformX: 100, scale: 2 });
</code></pre>

<h4>Statechart</h4>

<p>I love Statecharts. Every single project should have them. They simplify events and messaging, give you a central place for &quot;controller&quot; code and never leave you between states. They also pair wonderfully with a Router (see below). Ember.js has a fantastic implementation, if that&#39;s not available, the <a href="https://github.com/etgryphon/stativus">Stativus</a> project is basically the same code abstracted to be library agnostic.</p>

<p>One of these days, I&#39;m going to be able to write about Statecharts well. Until then, <a href="http://www.itsgotwhatplantscrave.com/2009/02/22/building-sproutcore-apps-with-statecharts-part-2/">try this article</a>.</p>

<h4>View Layer</h4>

<p>Like the Statechart, the View Layer is all about centralizing code related. A view handles what content should be in a HTML area, how to show it, how to hide it and how to handle events in that area. Without a View Layer, you&#39;ll end up with jQuery-itis, spaghetti code which all different parts of your codebase are updating the same DOM elements. This provides a nice simple API to your controllers and Statecharts:</p>

<pre><code>tooltipView.refresh();
tooltipView.show();
$(document).one(&#39;click&#39;, function() { tooltipView.hide(); });
</code></pre>

<p>Ember.js has my favorite implementation due to its ability to bind and auto-update elements. Backbone has a less magical, but still very-solid version.</p>

<h4>URL Router</h4>

<p>Applications should be deep-linkable when possible and since many Sites are becoming &quot;single page&quot; site which load other pages dynamically, they both need some mechanism for responding to URL changes on the client-side. Ember.js comes with a great router, if that&#39;s not available, I use <a href="https://github.com/joshbuddy/sherpa">Sherpa</a> which works in both the browser and on NodeJS. It&#39;s got a nice API:</p>

<pre><code>var sherpa = new Sherpa.Router();
sherpa.add(&#39;/test/:variable&#39;).to(&#39;testing&#39;);
sherpa.recognize(&#39;/test/hello&#39;); /*=&gt; {
  &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;testing&quot;,
  &quot;params&quot;: {
    &quot;variable&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;
  }
}*/
</code></pre>

<h4>Templating Library</h4>

<p>String concatination is not okay. It&#39;s ugly, hard to update, littered with double quotes, single quotes, escape characters, whitespace and plus signs. <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com">Handlebars</a> is a wonderfully powerful implementation of Mustache templates. Nice clean HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;
    {{body}}
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the project relies on Google Closure, then their Soy templates are the only option.</p>

<h4>Asset Loader</h4>

<p>You <em>could</em> just include normal <code>img</code> tags and CSS <code>background-images</code>, especially if the site was very traditional. But with an Application that has user data or many sections, it is probably a better idea to only load what you need. Multipage Sites would also benefit from waiting to load images on subsequent pages until the visitor actually requests them. Having a place to centralize all this loading (and queueing and prioritizing) is really useful. I use <a href="http://thinkpixellab.com/pxloader/">PxLoader</a>, which came out of the HTML5 version of Cut the Rope. I still use <code>img</code> tags and CSS for items which are always visible, but the Asset Loader can provide niceties like loading percentage bars and a central place for optimization.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>You might be saying, &quot;that&#39;s quite a bit of stuff!&quot; The nice thing about having a consistent stack is that it can be refined and improved from project to project. You don&#39;t have to be constantly writing some half-broken, untested implementation of a single piece of the stack. Just suck it up and let your dependency management and compiler deal with optimizing out the pieces you aren&#39;t using. We&#39;ve got 500kb Retina images on these sites, don&#39;t let worrying about 5kb of Javascript make your development more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
