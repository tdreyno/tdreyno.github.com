          <h2>Facebook the Devourer</h2>
          <time>Oct  4 2012</time>
          <p>I can&#39;t find a way to write this article without it sounding like a rant, so why fight it? <strong>The views and opinions expressed are my own and do not necessarily represent the views of my employer.</strong></p>

<p>Facebook is a social network with 1 billion users. It devours everything it touches and produces nothing of value, including&mdash;ironically&mdash;their stock price.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue that people are wasting time playing FarmVille, but I am going to argue that for such a massive collection of users, the output isn&#39;t very impressive. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/04/facebooks-new-ad-things-that-connect-us-chairs-universe_n_1939862.html">Look at this idiotic commercial</a>. They really want to project the idea that they&#39;re somehow making a difference in exchange for harvesting our personal life for advertisers.</p>

<h3>Devouring The Internet</h3>

<p>Facebook&#39;s famous for their walled garden. A walled garden filled with ads. To keep people on their pages, staring at those ads, they&#39;ve tried to take the Internet and move it inside Facebook.</p>

<p>They tried to move instant messaging inside Facebook. Calendaring. Photos. Booty calls. We had Google Calendar, Instagram, Flickr and SMS, they didn&#39;t do anyone a great service by ripping them off and locking them and the content inside Facebook.</p>

<p>Why are people sharing links to The Washington Post, a fucking print newspaper, that require installing a Facebook app to read! Because Facebook wants to eat that content, and Instagram posts, and all your check-in data, and your music playlists and pretend like everything&#39;s inside the garden so why would you go outside.</p>

<p>In Africa, they&#39;re going further to <a href="http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/">actively conflate Facebook with The Internet</a>.</p>

<h3>Devouring Culture</h3>

<p>As Christopher Poole mentioned at XOXO, we should take a look at the creative output of different communities. 4chan is a meme machine, constantly grinding to establish the culture of the internet. Youtube has launched not only memes, but entire careers. Reddit is quickly becoming the go-to place for creators and politicians to reach out to the Internet community with their AMAs. Folks are writing books in real-time on Google Docs. Twitter help people organize revolutions.</p>

<p>What memes, musicians or debates have come out of Facebook? Even Myspace had it&#39;s success stories. Rather, Facebook is happy to take people&#39;s boredom and opinions and funnel it inward into endless comment threads. Do they care that nothing useful is coming from this? Not as long as everyone&#39;s refreshing new ads.</p>

<h3>Devouring People</h3>

<p>I said I wasn&#39;t going to complain about the wasted time on Facebook, but I will complain about the wasted talent on Facebook. The best and brightest have been lured into the beast with giant paychecks, childish perks and the idea that somehow a new blue square button on Facebook is the best possible way they can change the world.</p>

<h3>Remember Facebook?</h3>

<p>There are websites that have become core pieces of the Internet, without which we would be left with a giant hole. Imagine an Internet without Google, Amazon or Wikipedia. Sure, they could be replaced in time, but the absence would be felt.</p>

<p>If Facebook disappeared tomorrow, nobody would give a shit. They would move on, like they moved on from Myspace. They would find another instant messaging app. They would find a different calendar. They&#39;d use email. And they&#39;d do it overnight because they&#39;re simply a pile of communication technologies for which we have plenty of replacements already. There&#39;s nothing special about Facebook to miss and for a giant, wealthy company with a billion usersâ€¦ that&#39;s pretty sad.</p>
